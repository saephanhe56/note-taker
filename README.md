Express.js Note Taker

## Description

For this homework challenge, we were to create an svg logo generator through node using objecct oriented programming. This challenge requires installing node, jest, and inquirer beforehand. Then I wrote the code in JavaScript that will create the color and shapes when "node index.js" is entered in the terminal. There will be a prompt of questions where user input is required then it will generate the svg logo. See video link below at the end for walkthrough example.

## Installation

Clone the github repo to your local computer and install node and npm i to use locally. Or click the heroku link.

## Usage

After cloning the repository and installing the required programs, open your terminal. Once you enter npm install, run node server.js. This app helps the user create notes and delete notes.
